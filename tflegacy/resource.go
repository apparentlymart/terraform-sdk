// Resource represents a thing in Terraform that has a set of configurable
// attributes and a lifecycle (create, read, update, delete).
//
// The Resource schema is an abstraction that allows provider writers to
// worry only about CRUD operations while off-loading validation, diff
// generation, etc. to this higher level library.
//
// In spite of the name, this struct is not used only for terraform resources,
// but also for data sources. In the case of data sources, the Create,
// Update and Delete functions must not be provided.

	// as data that might be computed in the process of creating this
	// resource.

	// SchemaVersion is the version number for this resource's Schema
	// definition. The current SchemaVersion stored in the state for each

	// when Schema semantics change. If the State's SchemaVersion is less than
	// the current SchemaVersion, the InstanceState is yielded to the
	// MigrateState callback, where the provider can make whatever changes it
	// needs to update the state to be compatible to the latest version of the
	// Schema.
	//
	// When unset, SchemaVersion defaults to 0, so provider authors can start
	// their Versioning at any integer >= 1

	// The function is yielded the state's stored SchemaVersion and a pointer to
	// the InstanceState that needs updating, as well as the configured
	// provider's configured meta interface{}, in case the migration process
	// needs to make any remote API calls.

	// StateUpgraders contains the functions responsible for upgrading an
	// existing state with an old schema version to a newer schema. It is

	// for legacy schemas that weren't recorded and can be handled by

	// The functions below are the CRUD operations for this resource.
	//
	// The only optional operation is Update. If Update is not implemented,
	// then updates will not be supported for this resource.
	//
	// The ResourceData parameter in the functions below are used to
	// query configuration and changes for the resource as well as to set
	// the ID, computed data, etc.
	//
	// The interface{} parameter is the result of the ConfigureFunc in
	// the provider for this resource. If the provider does not define
	// a ConfigureFunc, this will be nil. This parameter should be used
	// to store API clients, configuration structures, etc.
	//
	// If any errors occur during each of the operation, an error should be
	// returned. If a resource was partially updated, be careful to enable
	// partial state mode for ResourceData and use it accordingly.
	//
	// Exists is a function that is called to check if a resource still
	// exists. If this returns false, then this will affect the diff
	// accordingly. If this function isn't set, it will not be called. It
	// is highly recommended to set it. The *ResourceData passed to Exists
	// should _not_ be modified.

	// CustomizeDiff is a custom function for working with the diff that
	// Terraform has created for this resource - it can be used to customize the
	// diff that has been created, diff values not controlled by configuration,
	// or even veto the diff altogether and abort the plan. It is passed a
	// *ResourceDiff, a structure similar to ResourceData but lacking most write
	// functions like Set, while introducing new functions that work with the
	// diff such as SetNew, SetNewComputed, and ForceNew.
	//
	// The phases Terraform runs this in, and the state available via functions
	// like Get and GetChange, are as follows:
	//
	//  * New resource: One run with no state
	//  * Existing resource: One run with state
	//   * Existing resource, forced new: One run with state (before ForceNew),
	//     then one run without state (as if new resource)
	//  * Tainted resource: No runs (custom diff logic is skipped)
	//  * Destroy: No runs (standard diff logic is skipped on destroy diffs)
	//
	// This function needs to be resilient to support all scenarios.
	//
	// If this function needs to access external API resources, remember to flag
	// the RequiresRefresh attribute mentioned below to ensure that
	// -refresh=false is blocked when running plan or apply, as this means that
	// this resource requires refresh-like behaviour to work effectively.
	//
	// For the most part, only computed fields can be customized by this
	// function.
	//
	// This function is only allowed on regular resources (not data sources).

	// Importer is the ResourceImporter implementation for this resource.

	// Timeouts allow users to specify specific time durations in which an

	// AWS RDS Instance due to it's size, or restoring from a snapshot.
